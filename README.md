# broudy-utils
A bunch of Linux (and some MacOS) utils in Bash (and some Perl, Python)

Introduction
------------

These files represent some scripts that I've found useful over the years. Some a really simple and I just include them to a have a single point of distribution. Others might make good starting point for things you want to accomplish. I used a liberal license so you can use them as you see fit.

Usage
-----

It's doubtful that you'll want to clone this whole repo and use it wholesale, but I clone this to /broudy/common on all my servers and add /broudy/common/bin to my path.
